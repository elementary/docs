### Do I need to know Vala?

Major experience with Vala is not assumed, but basic programming knowledge is and experience with similarly syntaxed languages will be valuable. If you're not familiar with Vala, there are great resources—text and video—available for learning Vala on [Valadoc.org](https://valadoc.org/).

### Does this guide cover design principles?

Design is covered in the [Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)](https://docs.elementary.io/hig/). We reference the HIG throughout this guide and it's important you grasp the concepts proposed there, but this guide is focused primarily on code.

### Do I need to read this guide in order?

We recommend to at least skim "[The Basic Setup](writing-apps/the-basic-setup.md)" first, but sections are generally written to be standalone tutorials and will reference other parts of the guide where necessary.

### Where I can get help?

We use GitHub discussions for Q\&A as well as a place to submit ideas or show off what you're working on! [Join the community](https://github.com/elementary/docs/discussions)
