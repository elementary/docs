### Do I need to know Vala?

The examples in this documentation use Vala, but the libraries and concepts used to build apps for elementary OS also work with a number of popular languages like C, Python, Go, Rust, etc. We don't assume extensive expertise in Vala in this guide, but basic programming knowledge and experience with object-oriented programming languages will be valuable.

If you're not familiar with Vala and want to learn, there are great resources available on [the Vala website](https://vala.dev/)

### Does this guide cover design principles?

Design is covered in the [Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)](https://docs.elementary.io/hig/). We reference the HIG throughout this guide and it's important you grasp the concepts proposed there, but this guide is focused primarily on code.

### Do I need to read this guide in order?

We recommend to at least skim "[The Basic Setup](writing-apps/the-basic-setup.md)" first, but sections are generally written to be standalone tutorials and will reference other parts of the guide where necessary.

### Where I can get help?

We use GitHub discussions for Q\&A as well as a place to submit ideas or show off what you're working on! [Join the community](https://github.com/elementary/docs/discussions)
